## Submission for the Codecademy WEB DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATIONS Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website  

**Occult Research Club from Jujutsu Kaisen**

It's meant to demonstrate several of the responsive design tools I learned.

In this example project, I use percentages and relative units like rem, in the CSS to size and position page elements.

I made the website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen. 

I explored other possible responsive design concepts by 

1) making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size,
2) using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints,
3) employing responsive units rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
